# 🚦 Traffic Congestion Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts traffic congestion levels (Low, Medium, High) using machine learning. It analyzes vehicle count, time of day, temperature, weather conditions, and day type to determine traffic intensity.

The model is trained using a Random Forest classifier and deployed as a web application using Streamlit.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a machine learning system that can accurately predict traffic congestion and demonstrate real-world smart transportation applications.
